## Overview

<img src="./screenshot.png" alt="Project Screenshot"/>

This project was built using ReactJS, and is among one of the early projects on ReactJS. I learnt a lot of things while building this project and also enjoying ReactJs.

<h4><strong> Things Learnt: </strong></h4>
- Passing Data to child components
- Loops inside JSX for making HTML Elements
- Got to know about 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML' in React.
- Applying CSS on first-child

<h4><strong> Queries & Questions which I need to figure out going forward: </strong></h4>
- Struggling with naming of CSS Classes. How the naming should be done? Tried my best to make the css file maintainable.
- Would it be better while maintaining the project if we make different CSS files for different components?
- How do I get my code reviewed to know what things I did incorrectly and could be improved.

### Built With
